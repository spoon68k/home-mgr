## NVIM Hints and Tips

At this stage I've enabled a few very basic plugins not to get overwhelmed.

Some stuff I've configured:

leader      - set to ','
leader f    - toggle NvimTree
leader t    - open telescope
noremap Y Y - make yank work the way I am used to (with the newline)

### General VIM

<ctrl>-w left|right   - to toggle between panels
: <cmd>               - runs the command in the shell
:qa!                  - quit all

### Code Editing

V     - select lines visually
>     - indent
<     - outdent
gg=G  - retab file

### NVimTree

Remember that 'g?' opens help

f - set a filter
F - clear a filter
< - up in the current group
> - down in the current group
